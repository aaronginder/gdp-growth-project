# BigQuery Transformation dbt Data Pipeline

## What is dbt?
The data build tool (dbt) is a CLI that empowers analytics developers, data engineers and scientists to run the transform part of ETL. The rise of cloud providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon, Azure and Snowflake that provide products for extraction has led to tools such as dbt or dataform being created.

dbt is responsible for the orchestration of sql queries by abstracting the complexities around DAG creation and allows users with little to minimum coding experience the ability to create complex data pipelines using yaml configuration and sql only.

## Example BigQuery Pipeline
### Introduction
This repository is a good starting point for those just getting to grips with dbt. This repository shows configurations for the gdp_growth_project pipeline. The purpose of the pipeline is to bring together two tables in a format that calculates the GDP per person (yes, not the most existing!).

###

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
